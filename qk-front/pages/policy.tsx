                              is provided by Intuition Machines, Inc., a Delaware US Corporation (&quot;IMI&quot;). hCaptcha is
                              used to check whether the data entered on our website (such as on a login page or contact
                              form) has been entered by a human or by an automated program. To do this, hCaptcha
                              analyzes the behavior of the website or mobile app visitor based on various
                              characteristics. This analysis starts automatically as soon as the website or mobile app
                              visitor enters a part of the website or app with hCaptcha enabled. For the analysis,
                              hCaptcha evaluates various information (e.g. IP address, how long the visitor has been on
                              the website or app, or mouse movements made by the user). The data collected during the
                              analysis will be forwarded to IMI. hCaptcha analysis in the &quot;invisible mode&quot; may take
                              place completely in the background. Website or app visitors are not advised that such an
                              analysis is taking place if the user is not shown a challenge. Data processing is based on
                              Art. 6(1)(f) of the GDPR (DSGVO): the website or mobile app operator has a legitimate
                              interest in protecting its site from abusive automated crawling and spam. IMI acts as a
                              &quot;data processor&quot; acting on behalf of its customers as defined under the GDPR, and a
